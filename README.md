swagger4spring-web
==================

This project aims at providing Swagger support to your Spring-Web based application.  It will attempt to document your API based on existing Spring-Web annotations if no Swagger annotations exist.  If Swagger annotations do exist, it will utilize those in conjunction with the Spring-Web annotations.

##How-To

To include swagger4spring-web in your project, you need to include the jar in your project.  If you use Maven, please include the following dependency:

        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.knappsack</groupId>
            <artifactId>swagger4spring-web</artifactId>
            <version>0.1.2</version>
        </dependency>


In order to use swagger4spring-web in your project, you need to declare an ApiDocumentationController bean in your
servlet context.  For example:

        <beans:bean id="documentationController" class="com.knappsack.swagger4springweb.controller.ApiDocumentationController"
                p:basePath="http://localhost:8080/yourapp"
                p:baseControllerPackage="com.knappsack.swagger4springweb.controllers.api"
                p:baseModelPackage="com.knappsack.swagger4springweb.models"
                p:apiVersion="v1" />

* basePath - optional - the base URL of your web application, for example http://localhost/swagger4spring-web-example
* baseControllerPackage - optional - this is the package you want swagger4spring-web to scan to look for classes annotated with @Controller.  If this is not set, all your packages are scanned.
* baseModelPackage - optional - this is the package you want to scan if all your model objects are in a specific directory.  These classes will be added to your documentation schema.  If no package is specified only certain return types and parameters are added to the documentation schema.
* apiVersion - required - this is the version of your API

Once the ApiDocumentionController is wired, you may call go to your base path + /api/resourceList (ex: http://localhost/swagger4spring-web-example/api/resourceList) in order to retrieve an inventory of your APIs.

To see a working example, please take a look at [swagger4spring-web-example](https://github.com/wkennedy/swagger4spring-web-example/ "swagger4spring-web-example").
